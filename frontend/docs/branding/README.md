# Branding Guidelines

Welcome to the **PragmaStack** branding guidelines. This section defines who we are, how we speak, and how we look.

## Contents

- **[01. Brand Values & Mission](./01-brand-values.md)** - Our core principles and voice.
- **[02. Visual Identity](./02-visual-identity.md)** - Logo, colors, and typography usage.

## Relationship with Design System

While these branding guidelines define the _soul_ and _identity_ of the project, the **[Design System](../design-system/README.md)** provides the _technical implementation_ and _components_ to build it.

- **Branding**: "Why we use this blue."
- **Design System**: "How to use the `bg-primary` class."
